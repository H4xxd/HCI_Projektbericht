@book{CleanArchitecture,
  abstract = {By applying universal rules of software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary software craftsman Robert C. Martin ('Uncle Bob') reveals those rules and helps you apply them. Martin's Clean Architecture doesn't merely present options. Drawing on over a half-century of experience in software environments of every imaginable type, Martin tells you what choices to make and why they are critical to your success. As you've come to expect from Uncle Bob, this book is packed with direct, no-nonsense solutions for the real challenges you'll face---the ones that will make or break your projects.},
